NEXT STOP (Know your stop)
Every detail about the project->
  The project is not what it was meant to be. I haven't able to get the list of places or precisely the list of bus stops between 
  the origin and the destination. However it supports the following:-
  
  1. The main bus route 
      The map on in the project will show the route of the bus. There is a section explaining about the route info(origin,
      destination,total distance,time,fare)
      However it misses the next stop section, as mentioned above at the top, I wasn't able to get the list of bus stops.
  2. New passenger can be added from the ADD nav. It will show the fare to be paid.
  3. View nav will dynamically update the list of passengers. However removing the passengers will only be done when their 
      stop has arrived, but not functioning because no list of bus stops is maintained.
  4. Update nav will update the current passenger's drop point and will display the extra fare to be paid.
  
  NOTE: If I had only the list of bus stops between the origin and the destination then the software would have been complete 
        as described in the idea. I was able to this much only. Hope it would be appreciated. Thank YOU!
        
        
  You can view the project from your local apache server.
  Downlaod all the files and run index.php on the server.
  I have also uploaded a video of the working of the software. You might look at it instead of doing all the manual running 
  on the server.
