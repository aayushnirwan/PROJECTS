# Q. Whom is it for ?
Our product ESOP will be targeting all the audiences who are willing to get their basic
needs and services automated.

# Q. What problem does it solves ?
It brings all the local stores and markets who offer these basic needs at a single place.
This product majorly targets the audience who are unaware of these local stores in their
locality.

# Q.What alternatives are available ?
There are available websites like JustDial.com who also offer these services. However,
they only provide the location and contact info about those stores. Our product will also
integrate a payment gateway so that the users can avail these services without redirecting
anywhere else.

# Q.Why is this project compelling and worth developing?
Lets take the example of our own institution, when the next batch will arrive, each and
every one of them will require these basic facilities. So, this product will enable them to
get every details about the local stores and services nearby.
