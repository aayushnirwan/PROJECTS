# Usability:
The systemâ€™s user interface will be very simple and self-explanatory. They are very easy to
adapt to and use. The users just have to touch the option they want. They will each be able to access the tables that they are responsible for.

# Reliability:
The system is guaranteed to be reliable. All inputs to the system will be selections from
options that the system will show on the screen. Since the system will only provide valid
options, there is absolutely no possibility that invalid inputs can be entered. Each user
will have a unique username and password. This removes the risk of unauthorized access
to the system. Also, users can only access parts of the system that they require for their
job.

# Performance:
The system will be used by many employees of the restaurant at the same time and can
handle it without any errors. However, for this to happen, the server at the restaurant
should be able to handle all the traffic without creating any problems. The restaurant
should also have a high speed wireless connection for the system to perform its best. 

# Supportability:
The system will support changes that the restaurant might need to make in future. The
manager will have the ability to modify items from the menu.

# Implementation Requirements:
We plan to utilize HTML/CSS for the front-end and Django and dbsqlite as our database in the back-end.

# Interface Requirements:
The system requires both the manager and the cook to have desktop or laptop which should be connected to internet.
