# PLAN THE SOLUTION

# Q1. Have you seen similar problems before ?
Ans. Yes, we have seen similar problems before. We have observed similar patterns in all the available potential solutions which lack a common basic facility.
Yes, there are existing softwares which implements the functions and features proposed by us. But we have some added functionalities.

# Q2. Has a similar problem been solved ?
Ans. As far as we have researched we haven't found any product which performs all the functionalties proposed by our product, ESOP. There are some potential rivals present 
like- justdial.com, uberclap.com etc.
However, the above solutions lack a basic facility that we will be providing, i.e payment facility.

# Q3. Can you represent a solution in a manner that leads to effective implementation?
Ans. Yes we can represent this solution graphically. By using a flow chart we can define a process flow.
It will give you a high level obverview of the process flow.
